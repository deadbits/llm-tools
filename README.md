Small tools to assist with using local Large Language Models (LLM)

## Overview ðŸ“–
The ability to run an LLM on your home computer is a huge resource for productivity and development, among many, many other things. This repo contains a handful of one-off scripts and demos that aim to assist user interactions with locally hosted LLMs. 

Each script provides an inference interface to its respective model, and some demonstrates functionality like using LangChain to provide access to tools or comparing chatting with a PDF document via LangChain and LlamaIndex.
